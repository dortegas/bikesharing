# bikesharing

## Overview
The project is about how we could start a similar New York City bike share business in Des Moines, Iowa, which would allow people to know the city and interact with who live there and who are using bikes for their commutes. The mechanics of making this business work might be quite different in Des Moines than in New York City. The first step is to figure out how the bike-share business works in New York City with the data analysis of Citi Bike bike-sharing program and the development of a business story in Tableau, and then create a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines.

## Resources
  - Framework: Python 3.9.7, Jupyter Notebook and Pandas 1.2.4
  - Datasource: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv from [Citi Bike Trip Histories](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
  - Visual analytics platform: Tableau Public 2021.4.1

## Results
We created a story that explains why we think, given the data, that starting a bike sharing company in Des Moines is a good idea: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.ortega.segura/viz/citibike_16401910386320/Citibike)
